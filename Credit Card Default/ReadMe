# Credit Default Classification Modeling at Taiwan International Bank

## Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model for classifying credit defaults at Taiwan International Bank. The aim is to develop an efficient model that can accurately predict whether a customer will default on their loan based on historical data. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms and techniques to optimize model performance and enhance predictive accuracy.

### Objectives

- To analyze and preprocess the dataset to extract meaningful insights.
- To implement different machine learning algorithms for credit default classification.
- To evaluate and compare the performance of these models using appropriate metrics.
- To select the best-performing model for deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical credit data from Taiwan International Bank, including features such as:

- Customer demographics
- Credit history
- Loan characteristics
- Previous defaults

This dataset is crucial for training the model to recognize patterns associated with credit defaults.

## Usage

Open the `Credit Default Classification Modeling at Taiwan International Bank.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook. The notebook includes the following sections:

### 1. **Data Loading**
This section loads the dataset and performs initial inspections to understand the structure and types of data available.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
In this part, missing values are handled, categorical variables are encoded, and features are normalized to prepare the data for modeling.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
A comprehensive analysis is conducted to visualize the relationships between features and the target variable (credit default). Insights gained here inform feature selection.

### 4. **Model Building**
Different models are implemented, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
Each model's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. The best-performing model is identified for further optimization.

### 6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
The selected model undergoes hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV to enhance its performance.

### 7. **Final Model Selection**
The best model, after tuning, is evaluated once more and compared against other models to validate its performance.

## Results

The results section summarizes the findings from the modeling process, highlighting the chosen model's performance metrics and visualizations.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to credit default classification, showcasing the process from data preparation to model selection. The insights and models developed can be valuable for Taiwan International Bank in assessing credit risk and making informed lending decisions.
